High Availability:

High availabilty is related to device only. Graceful restart and NSF are the same thing denoted differently in protocols.
Graceful restart in BGP only supports IPv4 and IPv6 address-family only.

NSF/Graceful-restart and NSR both requires SSO (Statefull Switchover in RSP)

Graceful restart / NSF for IGP: (XRv and CSR1000v only supported)
==========================

XRv/XE:

router isis 90
 nsf cisco
 nsr

router isis 50
 nsf ietf              =====> IETF mode sends state change updates to neighbor before GR/NSF while cisco mode does not do that.
 nsf interval 3
 nsf interface wait 60
 !

Graceful restart in BGP:
==============================
IOS/XE:

router bgp 50
 bgp ha-mode sso prefer 
 bgp graceful-restart restart-time 60
 bgp graceful-restart stalepath-time 185
 bgp graceful-restart
!
Show command:  sh bgp vpnv4 unicast all neighbors | in (BGP neighbor is|Graceful)

XRv:

router bgp 90
 neighbor-group RRs
  graceful-restart restart-time 60								// wait time after graceful restart
  graceful-restart stalepath-time 185							// time for graceful restart
  address-family vpnv4 unicast
   long-lived-graceful-restart capable							// activates graceful restart
   long-lived-graceful-restart stale-time send 185 accept 185	// time to wait for neighbor's graceful restart
  !

   long-lived-graceful-restart stale-time send 185 accept 185
  !

Graceful-maintainence/Graceful-Shutdown in BGP:
========================================
Graceful maintainence is configured only when we want to move traffic from current router to other. Means other router is preffered over this router.

XRv:

router bgp 90
 graceful-maintenance activate all-neighbors retain-routes		// enable graceful-maintenance globally
 neighbor-group RRs												// I-BGP neighbor
  graceful-maintenance
   local-preference 0
   activate
  !
 neighbor 199.4.8.8        										// E-BGP neighbor
  graceful-maintenance
   as-prepends 4
   activate
  !
 !

Show command:  sh bgp vpnv4 unicast neighbors detail | in "BGP neighbor is|Graceful"

XE:

router bgp 50
