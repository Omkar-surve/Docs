QoS: NBAR Configuration Guide - Configuring NBAR Using the MQC [Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers]
137-174 minutes

You can configure Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) using the functionality of the Modular Quality of Service (QoS) Command-Line Interface (CLI) (MQC). The MQC uses traffic classes and traffic policies (policy maps) to apply QoS features to classes of traffic and applications recognized by NBAR.

This module contains concepts and tasks for configuring NBAR using the MQC.

Prerequisites for Configuring NBAR Using the MQC

Before configuring NBAR using the MQC, read the information in the "Classifying Network Traffic Using NBAR" module.
Information About NBAR Coarse-Grain Classification
NBAR and the MQC Functionality

To configure NBAR using the MQC, you must define a traffic class, configure a traffic policy (policy map), and then attach that traffic policy to the appropriate interface. These three tasks can be accomplished by using the MQC. The MQC is a command-line interface that allows you to define traffic classes, create and configure traffic policies (policy maps), and then attach these traffic policies to interfaces.

In the MQC, the class-map command is used to define a traffic class (which is then associated with a traffic policy). The purpose of a traffic class is to classify traffic.

Using the MQC to configure NBAR consists of the following:

    Defining a traffic class with the class-map command.

    Creating a traffic policy by associating the traffic class with one or more QoS features (using the policy-map command).

    Attaching the traffic policy to the interface with the service-policy command.

A traffic class contains three major elements: a name, one or more match commands, and, if more than one match command exists in the traffic class, an instruction on how to evaluate these match commands (that is, match-all or match-any ). The traffic class is named in the class-map command line; for example, if you enter the class-map cisco command while configuring the traffic class in the CLI, the traffic class would be named "cisco."

The match commands are used to specify various criteria for classifying packets. Packets are checked to determine whether they match the criteria specified in the match commands. If a packet matches the specified criteria, that packet is considered a member of the class and is forwarded according to the QoS specifications set in the traffic policy. Packets that fail to meet any of the matching criteria are classified as members of the default traffic class.
NBAR and the match protocol Commands

NBAR recognizes specific network protocols and network applications that are used in your network. Once a protocol or application is recognized by NBAR, you can use the MQC to group the packets associated with those protocols or applications into classes. These classes are grouped on the basis of whether the packets conform to certain criteria.

For NBAR, the criterion is whether the packet matches a specific protocol or application known to NBAR. Using the MQC, network traffic with one network protocol (citrix, for example) can be placed into one traffic class, while traffic that matches a different network protocol (gnutella, for example) can be placed into another traffic class. Later, the network traffic within each class can be given the appropriate QoS treatment by using a traffic policy (policy map).

You specify the criteria used to classify traffic by using a match protocol command. The table below lists some of the available match protocol commands and the corresponding protocol or traffic type recognized and supported by NBAR.

Note 	

For a more complete list of the protocol types supported by NBAR, see the "Classifying Network Traffic Using NBAR" module.

How to Configure NBAR Using the MQC
Configuring DSCP-Based Layer 3 Custom Applications
SUMMARY STEPS

    enable
    configure terminal
    ip nbar custom name transport {tcp | udp | udp-tcp }id id
    dscp dscp-value
    exit

DETAILED STEPS
  	Command or Action 	Purpose
Step 1 	

enable
Example:


Device> enable

	

Enables privileged EXEC mode.

    Enter your password if prompted.

Step 2 	

configure terminal
Example:


Device# configure terminal

	

Enters global configuration mode.
Step 3 	

ip nbar custom name transport {tcp | udp | udp-tcp }id id
Example:

Device(config)# ip nbar custom mycustom transport tcp id 100

	
Specifies the transport protocol to match as TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP, and enters custom configuration mode.
Step 4 	

dscp dscp-value
Example:

Device(config-custom)# dscp ef

	

Specifies the differentiated service code points (DSCP) value.
Note  	

In cases where two custom applications have the same filters, the priority is set according to the order of configuration.
Step 5 	

exit
Example:

Device(config-custom)# exit

	
Exits custom configuration mode.
Managing Unclassified and Unknown Traffic

Some protocols require the analysis of more than one packet for NBAR classification. So packets sent until such a classification occurs are considered unknown . unknown final excludes these temporarily classified packets, and includes only those packets that are determined as unknown after the NBAR classification process.

By default, all traffic not matched to the unknown, are matched to a default class, as is the case with MQC.
Before you begin

Ensure that NBAR is fully configured. If NBAR is configured to match only a partial set of protocols, then all inactivate protocols are considered as unclassified traffic and hence unknown.
SUMMARY STEPS

    enable
    configure terminal
    class-map [match-all | match-any ] unknown
    match protocol unknown [final]
    end

DETAILED STEPS
  	Command or Action 	Purpose
Step 1 	

enable
Example:


Device> enable

	

Enables privileged EXEC mode.

    Enter your password if prompted.

Step 2 	

configure terminal
Example:


Device# configure terminal

	

Enters global configuration mode.
Step 3 	

class-map [match-all | match-any ] unknown
Example:


Device(config)# class-map match-all my-unknown

	

Creates a class map to be used for matching unknown traffic to a new class and enters class-map configuration mode.
Step 4 	

match protocol unknown [final]
Example:


Device(config-cmap)# match protocol unknown final

	

Configures NBAR to match unknown traffic.

    The unknown keyword signifies any traffic that is unclassified

    The unknown final signifies traffic that is determined by NBAR as unknown.

Step 5 	

end
Example:


Device(config-cmap)# end

	

(Optional) Returns to privileged EXEC mode.
You can now configure the following tasks

    Configuring a Traffic Policy

    Attaching a Traffic Policy to an Interface or sub-interface

Configuring a Traffic Policy

Traffic that matches a user-specified criterion can be organized into a specific class that can, in turn, receive specific user-defined QoS treatment when that class is included in a policy map.

To configure a traffic policy, perform the following steps.

Note 	

The bandwidth command is shown in Step 5. The bandwidth command configures the QoS feature class-based weighted fair queuing (CBWFQ). CBWFQ is just an example of a QoS feature that can be configured. Use the appropriate command for the QoS feature that you want to use. As of Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)ZY, CBWFQ is not supported on the Catalyst 6500 series switch that is equipped with a Supervisor 32/programmable intelligent services accelerator (PISA).

Note 	

For Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)ZY, an existing traffic policy (policy map) cannot be modified if the traffic policy is already attached to the interface. To remove the policy map from the interface, use the no form of the service-policy command.

Example:


	

(Optional) Specifies or modifies the bandwidth allocated for a class belonging to a policy map.

    Enter the amount of bandwidth as a number of kbps, a relative percentage of bandwidth, or an absolute amount of bandwidth.

Note  	

The bandwidth command configures the QoS feature class-based weighted fair queuing (CBWFQ). CBWFQ is just an example of a QoS feature that can be configured. Use the appropriate command for the QoS feature that you want to use.
Note  	

As of Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)ZY, CBWFQ is not supported on the Catalyst 6500 series switch that is equipped with a Supervisor 32/PISA.
Step 6 	

end
Example:


Device(config-pmap-c)# end

	

(Optional) Returns to privileged EXEC mode.
Attaching a Traffic Policy to an Interface or Subinterface

After a policy map is created, the next step is to attach the traffic policy (sometimes called a policy map) to an interface or subinterface. Traffic policies can be attached to either the input or output direction of the interface or subinterface.

Note 	

Depending on the needs of your network, you may need to attach the traffic policy to an ATM PVC, a Frame Relay data-link connection identifier (DLCI), or other type of interface.

To attach a traffic policy (policy map) to an interface, perform the following steps.
SUMMARY STEPS

    enable
    configure terminal
    interface type number [name-tag ]
    pvc [name ] vpi / vci [ilmi | qsaal | smds | l2transport ]
    exit
    service-policy {input | output } policy-map-name
    end

DETAILED STEPS
  	Command or Action 	Purpose
Step 1 	

enable
Example:


Device> enable

	

Enables privileged EXEC mode.

    Enter your password if prompted.

Step 2 	

configure terminal
Example:


Device# configure terminal

	

Enters global configuration mode.
Step 3 	

interface type number [name-tag ]
Example:


Device(config)# interface ethernet 2/4 

	

Configures an interface type and enters interface configuration mode.

    Enter the interface type and the interface number.

Step 4 	

pvc [name ] vpi / vci [ilmi | qsaal | smds | l2transport ]
Example:


Device(config-if)# pvc cisco 0/16

	

(Optional) Creates or assigns a name to an ATM permanent virtual circuit (PVC), specifies the encapsulation type on an ATM PVC, and enters ATM virtual circuit configuration mode.

    Enter the PVC name, the ATM network virtual path identifier, and the network virtual channel identifier.

Note  	

This step is required only if you are attaching the policy map to an ATM PVC. If you are not attaching the policy map to an ATM PVC, advance to Step 6.
Step 5 	

exit
Example:


Device(config-atm-vc)# exit

	

(Optional) Returns to interface configuration mode.
Note  	

This step is required only if you are attaching the policy map to an ATM PVC and you completed Step 4. If you are not attaching the policy map to an ATM PVC, advance to Step 6.
Step 6 	

service-policy {input | output } policy-map-name
Example:


Device(config-if)# service-policy input policy1 

	

Attaches a policy map (traffic policy) to an input or output interface.

    Specify either the input or output keyword, and enter the policy map name.

Note  	

Policy maps can be configured on ingress or egress Devices. They can also be attached in the input or output direction of an interface. The direction (input or output) and the Device (ingress or egress) to which the policy map should be attached vary according your network configuration. When using the service-policy command to attach the policy map to an interface, be sure to choose the Device and the interface direction that are appropriate for your network configuration.
Note  	

After you use the service-policy command, you may see two messages similar to the following:


%PISA-6-NBAR_ENABLED: feature accelerated on input direction of: [interface name and type
]
%PISA-6-NBAR_ENABLED: feature accelerated on output direction of: [interface name and type

While both of these messages appear, NBAR is enabled in the direction specified by the input or output keyword only.
Step 7 	

end
Example:


Device(config-if)# end

	

(Optional) Returns to privileged EXEC mode.
Verifying NBAR Using the MCQ

After you create the traffic classes and traffic policies (policy maps), you may want to verify that the end result is the one you intended. That is, you may want to verify whether your traffic is being classified correctly and whether it is receiving the QoS treatment as intended. You may also want to verify that the protocol-to-port mappings are correct.

To verify the NBAR traffic classes, traffic policies, and protocol-to-port mappings, perform the following steps.

Configuration Examples for Configuring DSCP-Based Layer 3 Custom Applications
Example Configuring a Traffic Class

In the following example, a class called cmap1 has been configured. All traffic that matches the citrix protocol will be placed in the cmap1 class.


Device> enable  


Device# configure  terminal  


Device(config)# class-map  cmap1  


Device(config-cmap)# match  protocol  citrix  


Device(config-cmap)# end  

Example Configuring a Traffic Policy

In the following example, a traffic policy (policy map) called policy1 has been configured. Policy1 contains a class called class1, within which CBWFQ has been enabled.


Device> enable  


Device# configure  terminal  


Device(config)# policy-map  policy1  


Device(config-pmap)# class  class1  


Device(config-pmap-c)# bandwidth  percent  50  


Device(config-pmap-c)# end  


Note 	

In the above example, the bandwidth command is used to enable Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ). CBWFQ is only an example of one QoS feature that can be applied in a policy map. Use the appropriate command for the QoS feature that you want to use. As of Cisco IOS Release 12.2(18)ZY, CBWFQ is not supported on the Catalyst 6500 series switch that is equipped with a Supervisor 32/PISA.
Example Attaching a Traffic Policy to an Interface or Subinterface

In the following example, the traffic policy (policy map) called policy1 has been attached to Ethernet interface 2/4 in the input direction of the interface.


Device> enable  


Device# configure  terminal  


Device(config)# interface  ethernet  2/4   


Device(config-if)# service-policy  input  policy1  


Device(config-if)# end  

Example Verifying the NBAR Protocol-to-Port Mappings

The following is sample output of the show ip nbar port-map command. This command displays the current protocol-to-port mappings in use by NBAR. Use the display to verify that these mappings are correct.


Device# show ip nbar port-map
port-map bgp      udp 179 
port-map bgp      tcp 179 
port-map cuseeme  udp 7648 7649 
port-map cuseeme  tcp 7648 7649 
port-map dhcp     udp 67 68 
port-map dhcp     tcp 67 68 

If the ip nbar port-map command has been used, the show ip nbar port-map command displays the ports assigned to the protocol.

If the no ip nbar port-map command has been used, the show ip nbar port-map command displays the default ports. To limit the display to a specific protocol, use the protocol-name argument of the show ip nbar port-map command.
Example: L3 Custom any IP Port


Device> enable
Device# configuration terminal
Device (config)# ip nbar custom mycustom transport udp-tcp
Device(config-custom)# dscp ef
Device (config-custom)# exit
