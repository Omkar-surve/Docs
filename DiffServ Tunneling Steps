DiffServ Tunneling Steps:

Uniform pipe mode:
===========================
1) No need to perform any special mechanism for customer traffic entering Provider's network.
2) At egress PE:
	a) MPLS EXP to IP Precedence marking is required.
		This can be achieved by MPLS EXP --> QoS Group and QoS Group --> IP Precedence mapping
		MPLS EXP travels over entire MPLS VPN cloud while QoS Group is local to router.
	
Short Pipe Mode:
=======================
CE DSCP markings are preserved in whole process.
1) Ingress PE marks each CE packets independently and does not modify original DSCP marking.
2) Traffic entering MPLS VPN cloud is policied and marked based on ingress PE policy
3) Traffic exiting out of MPLS VPN cloud is queued and shaped based on original CE DSCP markings.
4) No need of MPLS EXP --> QoS Group and QoS Group --> IP Precedence mapping at egress PE
