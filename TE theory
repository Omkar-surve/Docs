Assigning traffic to TE
QoS
Inter-As




introduces explicit routing
constraint-based routing
admission control
uses RSVP-TE to establish LSPs
supports re-optimization
it's unidirectional


TE Mechanisms steps:
====================
1) Link information distribution
2) Path calculation
3) Path setup
4) Forwarding traffic to the tunnel

STEP 1) Link information distribution
==========================================
- Flood link information -- isis or ospf extension
	--for isis -- wide metrics is required
-Link information
	interface address
	neighbor address
	physical bandwidth
	maximum reservable BW
	unreserved BW (at eight priorities)
	TE metric (administrative weight)
	Administrative group (attribute flags)
- All TE node build a TE topology database

STEP 2) Path Calculation
========================================
-TE nodes perform constraint-based routing
-Headend responsible for path calculation.
-SPF check ignores paths that donot meet requirements
-Tunnel can be signaled once path is established.

STEP 3) Path Setup
==============================
-Tunnel signaled with RSVP-TE
-Soft state maintained with downstream PATH messages
-Soft state maintained woth upstream RESV messages
-LFIB populated using RSVP labels allocated by RESV messages

STEP 4) Forwarding traffic to the tunnel
==============================================
Tunnel path computation independent of backbone routing
Traffic enters in tunnel at headend
-Autoroute (announce or destination)
	-impacts routing decision only of headend router.
	-not visible to other TE routers
	-other TE routers may prefer other link towards headend
	-it's local to headend
-Forwarding Adjacency
	-impacts routing decision of all TE routers.
	-link is visible for all TE routers
	-can be preffered using metric commands
-Static route
-Policy Based Routing (PBR) (available on IOS, not on XR. On XR work-around using route-policy is availble)
==============================================================

TE Tunnel Attributes
===================
-unidirectional
-destination - tail
-priority / preemption (setup and hold) highesst is 0 lower is 7
-attributes / affinity
	coloring particular links in a way to allot that link for that particular traffic.
-bandwidth / loadshare
-local protection (FRR)
-Path options (explicit/dynamic)

===============================
Attribute Flags:
=====================
Affinity bits

Inter-AS TE
=============================
Option A and Option B ==> TE tunnels stiching
Option C and UMPLS ===> Inter-AS TE
